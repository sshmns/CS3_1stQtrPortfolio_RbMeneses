## Q1 End of Lessons Reflection
### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.
1. **Arithmic Operators** - These are symbols used to perform basic math operations like addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, and modulus `%`. They’re important because they let us calculate values, handle user input, and create logic for programs that rely on numbers. I know them very well since they are one of the first things I’ve learned and I’ve practiced them in countless problems. Understanding arithmetic operators deeply also helps in debugging, optimizing code, and explaining concepts clearly to others.
2.  **Conditional Statements** - This lets a program make decisions by checking if a condition is true or false. The most common ones are `if`, `else if`, and `else`, which control which block of code runs depending on the situation. They’re essential for creating interactive programs, like showing a message only if a user is logged in. I know them very well because they’re a core part of problem-solving in programming, and I’ve used them in many projects. This is also one of my favorite lessons.
3. **Logical Operators** - Logical operators in JavaScript are used to *combine* or *invert conditions*, making decisions more flexible. The three main ones are `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT). They’re powerful because they allow multiple conditions to be checked at once, like requiring two conditions to be true before running some code. I know them very well since they appear frequently in if statements, loops, and real projects where decision-making logic is needed. Through practice, I’ve learned how to use them effectively to simplify code and avoid writing overly complicated conditions.
4. **Operators** - Operators are special symbols used to perform actions on values or variables. Not just arithmetic, but also comparison `==`, `===`, `>`, `<` and logical `&&`, `||`, `!`. Operators are essential because they let us combine values, compare results, and control program flow. I know them very well since they appear in almost every line of code, and I’ve practiced them in many exercises since grade 7.
5. **Assignment Operators** - Assignment operators in JavaScript are used to assign values to variables and can also combine assignment with an operation. The most common is `=`, which sets a value, but there are also `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=` that update a variable’s value while performing arithmetic. They are useful for shortening code — for example, `x += 5` is cleaner than writing `x = x + 5`. 

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Variables** - This includes `var`, `let`, and `const`. I know how to declare and use them, but I still need more practice with scoping rules and understanding when to best use `let` or `const` in different situations.
2. **Loops** - These are the `for`, `while`, and `do..while`. I know how each loop works, but I need more practice in choosing the right loop for different problems, especially when working with arrays or nested loops.
3. **Functions** - I know how to define and call functions, but I need more practice writing reusable ones, understanding parameters vs. arguments, and using return values effectively.
4. **Arrays** - I can describe arrays and access elements, but I need more practice with built-in methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` to manipulate data efficiently.
5. **Strings** - I know strings are text data, but I need more practice with string methods (like `.slice()`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.replace()`) and handling user input properly.

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. **Variables** - Practice rewriting small programs using `var`, `let`, and `const` to see the differences in scope. Do short exercises where you intentionally reassign variables to figure out when `const` is better than `let`.
2. **Loops** - Solve small challenges, like printing multiplication tables, summing numbers, or generating patterns, using different loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`). Compare solutions: write the same problem with a `for` loop, then try it with `while` to see which feels cleaner.
3. **Functions** - Create simple functions (like add two numbers, check if a number is even, or convert Celsius to Fahrenheit). Practice writing the same function in different styles: regular function, function expression, and arrow function.
4. **Arrays** - Start by creating arrays of numbers, strings, or objects and practicing accessing elements with indexes. Do exercises with built-in methods: filter even numbers with `.filter()`, double numbers with `.map()`, or sum them with `.reduce()`.
5. **Strings** - Practice using string methods on short examples: slicing names, changing case, or replacing words in a sentence. Combine strings with arrays (like splitting a sentence into words) to see how they can work together.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
1. **Effective**
* Graded Coding Exercises - Doing practice coding exercises is effective because it turns theory into action — instead of just reading about a concept, you actually apply it and see how it works. Exercises help you discover gaps in your understanding, since you often run into errors that force you to think critically and debug. They also build muscle memory, making it easier to recall syntax and logic when solving problems later. Finally, practice gives you confidence: the more real examples you do, the less intimidating new topics feel because you’ve already built problem-solving habits.
* Group Work Activities -  Working in groups with my classmates was effective because not only do you get to bond with your group mates, but you also get to learn different ideas. It allows you to learn from different perspectives and approaches. When you explain a concept to others, it strengthens your own understanding and confidence, or when others explain concepts to you, you can pick up different strategies you might not have thought of.

2. **Not Effective**
* In my opinion, all of the activities done in class have positively affected me and there wasn’t an instance in class where I didn’t learn something new.
